# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis 

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a hotel booking dataset using Tableau. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into hotel reservations, customer behavior, identify revenue and cancelation patterns and make useful recommendations. The analysis is conducted through SQL queries for data exploration and Tableau for visualizations.

## Steps
1. **Data Import and Setup:**
   - The dataset (Excel file) was imported into a local Microsoft SQL Server database for querying.
   
2. **SQL Analysis:**
   - Employed SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis, extracting valuable insights and summary statistics on key variables.
   - Investigated critical aspects such as booking patterns, customer demographics, and cancelation trends.
     
3. **Tableau Visualization:**
   - Utilized Tableau Public to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
   - Feature engineering was applied to generate calculated fields, enhancing the depth of analysis.

The interactive [Tableau Dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/views/hotel_reservations/HotelResDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) is used to visualize insights obtained from the analysis.
